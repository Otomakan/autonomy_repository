# Framed Autonomy üêº

## What is Framed?
Framed is a minimalistic(ish) static website generator written in Node and relying on gulp as a build system. The generated website is intended to feel like a dynamic site. The page transitions doesn't rely on third party librairies so the JS is super minimalistic. It relies on `document.write()` so if that's a no no for you please suggest some other methods!

## Why Framed?
- Minimalistic. Framed is for building quickly fast website 
- Adaptable. The code is not complicated you have full control over your sass, html and content
- Dynamic. Framed can be use to 
- Static. No or minimal hosting costs for the win!

## Getting Started üöÄ
### Prerequisites Â≠¶

All you need is Node and npm installed and your machine. If you don't find out how here: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm.

### Setup ÈÄ†

First clone this repository, then run npm install
```
git clone https://github.com/Otomakan/framed-autonomy.git
cd framed-autonomy
npm install
```

## Usage ‚Ω§
### Build your site
If all the packages were installed properly all you need to do is go in your command line and type
```gulp```
And a browser sync will start a local server on port 3000 and open a window in your favorite browser.
Gulp has a bunch of watch functions which will update the website when it detects a file change

### Customize it 

Write your page templates in src/content/templates and the content of you page in a JSON format in src/content/contentJSON.
Gulp will read your template file and replace each ##key## in the template by the key provided in the JSON file. 

Don't forget to tell Gulp which template you are using in the JSON file. Here is an example 

```
{
	"template": "template-page",
	"title":"Template Page",
	"subtitle":"A Page about templates",
	"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmodtempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodoconsequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit essecillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat nonproident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.Lore"
}
```

The folder structure in contentJSON will become the structure of your website.
