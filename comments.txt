When you navigate , there is a weird problem probably has to do with with the customheader. "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no">"
How to reproduce: go to homepage click on "Monitoring"

Think about how to approach tablet navigation. Maybe use something like @media only screen 
and (max-device-height : 768px) 
and (max-device-width : 1024px)
Really think in terms of ratios.


Sometimes there is a bit of a weird bug in the front page when I close the first block, the div completely disappers instead of going back to the regular index.html display

Maybe we can create an energy savings calculator see: https://www.solarchoice.net.au/blog/introducing-commercial-solar-payback-calculator

think about making a PWA https://markentier.tech/posts/2018/04/progressive-web-app/

Look at how to incorporate "Load template" to the history .push function I created. Looks like there was something cool there
especially in combination with the navigation bar


Think abut using turbolink for navigation

Make a side menu like veolia.com

Maybe create an FAQ at the end of each page

make some more pages which aren't necessarily in the navbar, eg about financing, taxes..
Maybe have a section on Procurement

Position ourselves more as onsultants ith, maybe make some cool animations with data showing
