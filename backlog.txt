So to limit the loading we only load the content of the 'content' variable present in each template file .
Now the problem is that we might encounter some issues with double quotes in the javascript.
If there is a problem loding the page with our javascript make sure that it turns into a normal link
Really have to think harder about the file structure, how to you fetch css or js file dynamically
For the css, maybe what we can do is generate a file from scss, then append the relevant css to each page. So you parse all the class and ids then prepend them
Maybe create a really smart program for the css detection. Let the program find the relevant css for each page. Index each declaration, then spits out 
css files appended to the html and a global css file which only has recurring tags.
