Because of this useless power, the equipment needs additional, useful electricity (Real Power) to run. <h2>Power Factor Explained</h2>When you use electrical equipment (like lights), a portion of the power you use is distorted and becomes useless (Reactive Power). Because of this useless power, the equipment needs additional, useful electricity (Real Power) to run. <br/>The penalties for having a poor power factor can be high and add a significant cost to your monthly bill.<br/><br/> Energy retailers measure your power factor on a scale between zero (poor) and one (optimal efficiency). This is how they calculate your kVA charge.<br/><br/><h2>MINIMISING KVA WITH MANAGE MY POWER FACTOR CORRECTION</h2>Manage My Power factor correction equipment reduces the kVA demand charge on your electricity bill. Our equipment uses capacitors to remove the distorted power, so you only pay for the Real Power (or liquid beer in the info graphic above)."
