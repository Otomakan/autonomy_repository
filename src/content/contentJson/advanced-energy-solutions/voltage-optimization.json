	"content":"Autonomy Voltage Optimisation brings the voltage within your business to the optimum level for the efficient and safe operation of your equipment. <br/>When your equipment receives voltage within this optimum range, it consumes less power and lasts longer - resulting in significant financial savings for your business.<h2>HOW MUCH VOLTAGE DOES A BUSINESS NEED?</h2>The allowable voltage range in Australia is 216-253 volts (AS60038), and due to the nature of the electricity grid, most buildings receive voltage on the higher end of this range.<br/><br/> Because most Australian equipment is designed to run at a particular voltage, it will not run at its optimum state when it receives a higher voltage. This often leads to an increase in equipment repairs, maintenance and replacements.<br/><h2>VOLTAGE OPTIMISATION AND ROI</h2>Approximately 70% of buildings can achieve a commercially viable return on investment from a Manage My Power Voltage Optimisation solution.<br/><br/>Typically, our clients receive energy savings of between 8-12% and a 25-50% return on investment.</br></br>Our voltage optimisation solutions are customised to your site and are made in Australia, using the highest quality engineering standards (ISO9002), so you can rest assured, they are robust and reliable.",
