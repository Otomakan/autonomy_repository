	"para1":"Industrial activities are usually the best business case for Photovoltaic (PV solar) projects. We have on one hand high energy consumption and on the other a lot of roof space to install solar panels. <br/><br/>Relying on the grid can be a good strategy, but energy prices can be high and unpredictable. In 2017 we have seen energy prices rise by 11% because Hazelwood and the Northern Coal Power Stations closed down. Second, the price of producing electricity can be much cheaper.",

	"para2":"Businesses can save tremendous amounts of money on their energy bill if they adopt a data driven smart strategy. In industrial solar projects, just throwing as many solar panels on the roof will not cut it. In many cases buying electricity from the grid can be cheaper.<br/><br/>We collect quality data to identify production and consumption patterns to produce the unlock tremendous savings and mitigate the risks from an unstable grid. Our free audits are more than a solar quote, they are the first stone of an energy strategy. <br/><br/>There are other serious options to consider for industrial sites. Indeed high consumption usually means you can negotiate very good electricity deals with retailers. Also high loads often have to be managed to avoid over consumption and overuse of machinery. See our Power Factor and Voltage Optimization sections. <br/><br/>We have the latest energy technology. We have also automation options as well as cutting edge supply chain analytics to perform live analysis of the performance and output of your machines.",
