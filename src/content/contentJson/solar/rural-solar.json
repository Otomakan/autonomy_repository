The cost of getting electricity delivered is often higher than other areas and open space are ideal for cheaper , more robust and higher quality installations. <br/><br/>With larger surfaces it is easier to tailor a solar solution best suited to fit the electricity profile of your business. For larger sites, this means we can make economies of scale, making the cost of a KW lower per dollar spent. This means:<br/><br/><ul><li>Cheaper electricity</li><li>Faster Return on Investment</li><li> Easier Financing</li></ul><br/><br/>Rural site are also ideal to explore more advanced off-grid solutions at a higher price. Off-grid solutions allow you to have control over your consumption and mitigate risks link to grid blackouts (eg: South Australia 2016).
