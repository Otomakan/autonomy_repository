	"content":"Commercial Photovoltaic systems (PV solar) are a great tool to reduce monthly expenses and mitigate risks from volatile energy prices. Regardless of your business size, if energy consumption constitutes a great portion of your budget, then solar PV is a serious option to consider. <br/><br/>Relying on the grid can be a good strategy, but energy prices can be high and unpredictable. In 2017 we have seen energy prices rise by 11% because of the closure of Hazelwood and the Northern Coal Power Station. Second, the price of producing electricity can be much cheaper.<br/><br/>To design a proper commercial solar strategy many elements must be considered. The main key points are the energy rate structure, periods of consumption, and financing.<br/><br/>When we design a PV system we take multiple elements into consideration and will only recommend an installation we are sure we can save your business money. We usually aim for energy savings of a minimum of 8% and up to 30%, and a minimum risk-free return on investment of 5%. If our calculation does not reach this requirement, we also include in our audit a combination with other technologies such as batteries, power factor correction, or our proprietary energy management software. Sometimes the combination of technology is required to exponentially increase savings. <br/><br/>We are a small talented team which gives provides tailored personalized energy solutions for projects of any size. We can move quickly when it comes to project design and innovation integrations so you have the latest most robust energy technologies. "
